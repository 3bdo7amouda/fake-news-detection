# 📚 Fake News Detection - Technical Explanation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based fake news detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression. The system analyzes news articles and classifies them as "Real" or "Fake" based on textual patterns learned from authentic Kaggle datasets.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FakeNewsDetector Class** (`main.py`)
   - Handles text preprocessing, model training, and prediction
   - Manages model persistence and loading
   - Implements the complete ML pipeline

2. **Web Interface** (`app.py`)
   - Streamlit-based user interface with demo and detection tabs
   - Real-time processing with loading indicators
   - User-friendly result display

3. **Command Line Interface** (`main.py`)
   - Menu-driven CLI for quick testing
   - Options for demo and custom detection

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### 1. Text Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
def preprocess_text(self, text):
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = str(text).lower()
    # Remove URLs and special characters
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+|www\S+|https\S+', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    # Tokenize and remove stopwords
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in self.stop_words and len(token) > 2]
    return ' '.join(tokens)
```

**Key Steps:**
- Lowercase conversion for consistency
- URL and special character removal
- Tokenization and stopword filtering
- Short word removal (< 3 characters)

### 2. Feature Extraction with TF-IDF

```python
self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=10000,
    stop_words='english',
    ngram_range=(1, 2),  # Unigrams and bigrams
    min_df=2,           # Min document frequency
    max_df=0.8          # Max document frequency
)
```

**TF-IDF Configuration:**
- **10,000 max features** for computational efficiency
- **Unigrams + bigrams** to capture context
- **Document frequency filtering** to remove noise
- **Stop words removal** for better signal

### 3. Machine Learning Model

```python
self.model = LogisticRegression(
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42,
    max_iter=1000,
    C=1.0  # L2 regularization
)
```

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- **Balanced class weights** handle dataset imbalance
- **L2 regularization** prevents overfitting
- **Probabilistic output** provides confidence scores
- **Fast training and prediction** for real-time use
- **Interpretable results** for debugging

### 4. Training Data

The system uses authentic Kaggle datasets:
- **Fake.csv**: Collection of fake news articles
- **True.csv**: Collection of real news articles

**Data Processing:**
- Balanced sampling to prevent bias
- 80/20 train-test split with stratification
- Combined title and text for richer features

## 🔍 Detection Process

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Input Processing**
   - Combine title and article text
   - Apply text preprocessing pipeline

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Convert text to TF-IDF vectors
   - Use trained vectorizer for consistency

3. **Model Prediction**
   - Pass features to Logistic Regression
   - Get probability scores for both classes

4. **Result Generation**
   - Convert to human-readable format
   - Calculate confidence percentage

### Example Detection

```
Input: "AMAZING weight loss trick doctors don't want you to know"
       ↓
Preprocessing: "amazing weight loss trick doctors want know"
       ↓
TF-IDF: [0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2, ...] (10,000 features)
       ↓
Logistic Regression: [0.15, 0.85] (real, fake probabilities)
       ↓
Output: "Fake" with 85% confidence
```
